## Problem Statement :
Has this ever happened to you that you have planned on visiting on a trip or picnic and after reaching the destination it suddenly starts raining or the weather is too hot or too cold? Well this happens with me all the times and this is really frustating. So in order to tackle this problem I came up with an idea to make a Weather App so that I can check the weather and make plans and preperations accordingly.

## Proposed Solution :
Weather App is built using kotlin with the main purpose of showing the weather. It uses openweathermap API to get live and regular updates on the weather. Along with the temperature it also shows the weather like if the weather is clear it will show clear sky. It also shows the minimum and maximum temperature of the day. One more special feature is that it shows the timimg of sunset and sunrise which is a very handy feature. It also displays the wind speed, humidity in air and air pressure so that you can make your plans accordingly. Well there are various weather application available out there but the thing that distinguish this from other weather app is it's light weight and beautiful UI. The application is light weight (2.49 MB) which can run on almost all android devices (greater or equal to android v5.0). 

## Features :

- **Weather** - Displays the weather like clear sky,rainy,etc.
- **Minimum & Maximum Temp** - Displays the Minimum & Maximum Temperature.
- **Sunrise and Sunset** - Shows the timimg of sunset and sunrise.
- **Wind Speed** - Shows wind speed which makes it awesome.
- **Humidity** - Shows humidity of air.
- **Air Pressure** - Shows air pressure.
